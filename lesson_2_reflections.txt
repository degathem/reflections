Udacity Course How to Use Git and GitHub
Lesson 2 Reflections
Cameron Gillespie

What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	a hidden folder (.git) is added to the directory which is now acting as the repository. This command adds metadata which tracks git versioning

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area stages the edited file from the working directory before the are commited to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
	Run git diff, which checks the difference between the staging and the repository.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
	Branches help in adding an experimental feature, or perhaps a different mode for the program and still allow the developer to have a working copy of the main program.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
	They help by seeing where the branches occur and what commits may be unreachable by the various branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
	The commits from the two branches are added to the tip.

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
	git isn't advanced enough to detect subtle differences, instead it can highlight where lines of code are different within a file.
	automatic merging can save a lot of time by automatically highlighting what was in the two merged files, what is the same and what is different.
